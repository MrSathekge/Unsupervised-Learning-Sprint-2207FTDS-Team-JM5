    "# Challenge Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In today’s technology driven world, recommender systems are socially and economically critical for ensuring that individuals can make appropriate choices surrounding the content they engage with on a daily basis. One application where this is especially true surrounds movie content recommendations; where intelligent algorithms can help viewers find great titles from tens of thousands of options.\n",
    "\n",
    "…ever wondered how Netflix, Amazon Prime, Showmax, Disney and the likes somehow know what to recommend to you? \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/header.png\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "…it's not just a guess drawn out of the hat. There is an algorithm behind it.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this context, EDSA challenged us to construct a `recommendation algorithm` based on `content` or `collaborative filtering`, capable of accurately predicting how a user will `rate` a movie they have not yet viewed based on their historical preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What value is achieved through building a functional recommender system?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Providing an accurate and robust solution to this challenge has immense economic potential, with users of the system being exposed to content they would like to view or purchase - generating revenue and platform affinity.\n",

The MovieLens dataset has long been used by industry and academic researchers to improve the performance of explicitly-based recommender systems, and now you get to as well!\n",

    "\n",
    "- genome_scores.csv - a score mapping the strength between movies and tag-related properties.\n",

    "- links.csv - File providing a mapping between a MovieLens ID and associated IMDB and TMDB IDs.\n",
    "- sample_submission.csv - Sample of the submission format for the hackathon.\n",
    "- tags.csv - User assigned for the movies within the dataset.\n",
